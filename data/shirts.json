    "description": "Newsflash: our edit of men’s shirts means business. When it comes to staple men’s white shirts and men’s black shirts, look no further than ASOS DESIGN for options that’ll take you from office to out-of-office. If the agenda is calling for men’s casual shirts, New Look is your go-to destination for men’s check shirts, plus plain and printed styles to match your mood. For a flex-worthy upper half, set your filters to Polo Ralph Lauren – think signature branding and loadsa different fabrics e.g. flannel, pique and poplin. C’mon, do the smart (or casj) thing."

          "content": "I’m 5’8” with big shoulders & arms and at 42 don’t have the 6 pack I used to. So only get the size you normally get if you’re extremely trim on the waist & abs. I got a L & XL when I’m usually medium. The L was too tight on shoulders & very tight round the waist. The XL fit on the shoulder & waist but it a weird cut, for me there but the shirt was very very long with really long sleeves. So I got it tailored to fit and I was very happy. Until I washed it and all the stitching came out everywhere except where I had it professionally tailored on the body length & sleeves. It’s a right mess now and cost me another £25 for the tailoring. My advice…. Proceed with caution on ASOS own clothes, the cut is weird & the stitching & build quality are rubbish. Friends have told me this too. Now I have a shirt I’ve spent £50 on I cannot wear.\nRead More",
