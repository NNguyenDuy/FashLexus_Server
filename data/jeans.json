    "description": "ICYDK, you can’t go wrong with a good pair of jeans. Enter: our edit of men’s jeans, a.k.a your new favorite denim destination. For the staple of all staples, scroll men’s blue jeans from ASOS DESIGN – we’re talking a wash to pair with whatever upper half you have in mind. If you’re after men’s black jeans or men’s skinny jeans, browse the selection from Jack & Jones (cos a low-key down-low option is a closet essential). We’re assuming no introduction is needed for OG Levi’s, but it’s not just classic fits on offer – expect men’s ripped jeans that’ll help you turn up the flex factor. Here’s to making every day a denim day."

My people, that are few in numbers, who enjoy painted on, comfortable stretch, amazing weight jeans…look no further because these are those jeans!!

          "content": "Love these jeans! I gave it a four because they were said to be a skinny jean, but they fit more like what other jeans makers would call super skinny jeans. Not complaining though. I've been looking for jeans that fit like this for some time. I've worn other super skinny jeans, but they are usually only from the knee down. These are snug all the way. Only complaint is that I wish they were tighter in the thigh. Color is great, feel is great. They have a soft, sensuous feel to them. Just love wearing them. Feel like I'm getting a hug. Can't say enough about how much I love these jeans. Hate having to take them off at the end of the day. I do have to give them a tug to get them off over my big feet. One other thing I like about them is there are no recycled materials in them. They are plain looking jeans, no leather patch on the back, no fancy artwork on the rear pockets. They go great with my sand colored combat boots. May want to get a different color. My biggest complaint is that there aren't many of their other jeans in my size. 32/30. I am curious about their spray on jeans. Would they fit tighter than these? What is the leg opening on them?\nRead More",
